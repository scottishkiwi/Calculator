# Calculator
HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript Calculator 

A fun implementation to build a simple calculator out of HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. Was inspired to try this after reading about the Javascripts eval() function takes a string of numbers and operations, and evaluates them for you. 
Design based on the original Apply iPhone calculator UI.
