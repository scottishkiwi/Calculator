# Calculator
HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS Calculator 

A fun implementation to see how long it would take to build a simple calculator out of HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. Was inspired to try this after discovering that Javascripts eval() function takes a string of numbers and operations, and evaluates them for you. 

To run, download HTML, CSS and JS files and open index.html in a browser.
